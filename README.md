# LinkedIn-Data-Exploration
The primary objective of this EDA project is to gain a deeper understanding of the LinkedIn dataset, uncover patterns and insights, and extract valuable information for job seekers, companies, and hiring professionals.
We aim to answer questions like: What are the most common job types? Are remote job opportunities increasing? How is company size correlated with job popularity? Who are the key hiring decision-makers, and what's the impact of LinkedIn followers?
